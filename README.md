# cifo_group7

Welcome to the cifo_group7 repository! This repository contains the final project for the Computer Intelligence for Optimization (CIFO) subject.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to solve the Stigler's Diet Problem using optimization techniques. The Stigler's Diet Problem aims to find the minimum price for a list of foods that satisfies the required nutritional values for a human being. In this project, we have made some adaptations, such as considering the solution over a year instead of daily.

## Optimization Technique

To tackle this optimization problem, we have employed Genetic Algorithm techniques. Genetic Algorithms are powerful search algorithms inspired by the principles of natural selection and genetics.

## Getting Started

To execute the algorithm and obtain the results, please follow these steps:

1. Download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `stigler_diet.py` file.

The algorithm will generate the results in the following formats:

- **CSV file**: Contains the average fitness values for different optimization combinations.
- **Graphs**: Two graphs showing the optimization progress over 100 generations.
- **TXT file**: Provides detailed information about the best individual found during the optimization process.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different optimization settings to achieve the best results!

We hope you find this project interesting and informative. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out. Enjoy optimizing the Stigler's Diet Problem!
